### Hi there! I'm Bradfordly.

#### Pronouns: He/Him

I'm currently working on:
* Game server management tools meant for individual users
* Enhancing Foundry VTT modules for my favorite TTRPGs
* Learning more about Rust and WebAssembly

Ask me about:
* Public cloud development
* Containerization
* Distributed system design & architecture

Fun fact: My first experience in tech was in highschool at the age of 17. I was appointed web master of my high school's public-facing website. Being webmaster was a part of my school's web design program. I was one of the few who completed the entire curriculum before reaching senior year.
