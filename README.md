### Hi there! I'm Bradfordly.

#### Pronouns: He/Him

I'm currently working on enhancing VTT modules for my favorite TTRPGs such as D&D, Numenera, Call of Cthulhu, and more.

I'm currently learning more about Rust and WebAssembly

Ask me about: public cloud development, containerization, distributed system design

Fun fact: My first experience in tech was in highschool at the age of 17. I was appointed web master of my high school's public-facing website. Being webmaster was a part of my school's web design program. I was one of the few who completed the entire curriculum.
