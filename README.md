### Hi there! I'm Bradfordly.

#### Pronouns: He/Him

I'm currently working on:

* Public cloud development
* Containerization
* Distributed system design & architecture

Fun fact: My journey into tech began in high school where I was one of three students who completed the Computer Science elective track. Our senior project involved being the adminstrators of our school's public facing website and developing an interactive portal to browse historical school newspapers. When not working on JavaScript in school, I was working on Lua scripting to customize World of Warcraft mods (RIP Flexbar).
